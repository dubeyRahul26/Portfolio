        I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from real-time chat
        applications to full-stack e-commerce platforms and dynamic product<br/>
        management systems. My experience includes building scalable MERN
        applications, integrating secure authentication, <br/>managing state
        efficiently with Zustand, and ensuring a seamless user experience<br/> with
        responsive UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Chakra UI.
